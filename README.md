* [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/) (_[netinstall](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst)_ and _[live](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/)_)
* [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)
* [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)
* [Kali](https://www.kali.org/)
* [Proxmox VE](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page)
* [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/download/)
* [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)
* [Android x86](https://www.android-x86.org/)

* [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/)
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)

Downloads will be verified against checksums and GPG keys when available. Checksums/signatures are downloaded as part of the process. The script will return warnings unless you manually import and trust gpg keys:

```
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

**Debian:** You need to [import Debian signing keys to your GPG keyring](https://keyring.debian.org/):

```bash
gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv-keys DF9B9C49EAA9298432589D76DA87E80D6294BE9B
```

Consider a periodic cleanup of old/obsolete images from your download directory, else disk usage will keep increasing over time (unless you intend to keep old distribution releases?).
